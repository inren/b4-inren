## What is it?
My personal wicket application for b4.

Pay attention:

* this code may or may not compile
* this code may have some crazy errors
* interfaces may change within hours
* parts of this code may just be stupid
* parts of code may have no documentation
* some classnames or method names will make no sense

This is my personal playground. All completed work will go to the main project.
You are free to uses the code found here, you have been warned and now know the risks
so don't complain later.
